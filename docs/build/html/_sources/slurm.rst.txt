Headless Slurm Runs Overview
============================

**Purpose**

A few optimizations and modifications are provided in order to have a smooth running of CLEDB on headless systems like research computing clusters. The `Slurm environment <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_ is utilized. 

Namely:

	* Instructions for resource allocation, installing, and running the inversion in both interactive and batch modes of Slurm research computing setups are provided.
	
	* The database building bash script has a dedicated headless version, *rundb_1line_slurm.sh*, where user options are hard-coded.

	* Pure python test scripts (test\_\*.py) are exported/generated from the Jupyter notebooks (test\_\*.ipynb) to be compatible with batch allocations.

A dedicated dedicated readme covering this topic can be :ref:`consulted here <readme-slurm-label>`. The instructions are provided following the templates set by the `Colorado University Research Computing User Guide <https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
