Motivation for the CLEDB approach:
==================================

By utilizing 2-line observations, we recover the 3D magnetic field information for single point voxels using a :math:`{\chi}^2` fitting approach. We employ the CLE spectral synthesis code to  generate forward-model calculations in the order of 10\ :sup:`7`\ -\ 10\ :sup:`9` atomic plasma and magnetic configurations are needed in order to satisfy a solution resolution criteria. Forward modeling such solutions in a dynamic fashion is time consuming. Such a calculation (e.g. iterating for 1 pixel) has execution times in the order of 10 hours, on a single thread, with a fast implementation of the FORTRAN CLE code. 

Building a separate database (the ``CLEDB\_BUILD`` module in our algorithm) to store a vast set of synthetic Stokes observations, along with the input plasma and magnetic field configurations responsible for producing polarized emission, proved to be a significantly more feasible approach. 

Additionally, the database theoretical calculations gain intrinsic access to otherwise un-observables input parameters (e.g. atomic alignment :math:`{\sigma}_0^2`, intrinsic magnetic field angles :math:`{\vartheta}_B`, :math:`{\varphi}_B` etc.) that can be used to break inherent degeneracies encountered when attempting analytical inversions (as for example occuring in the 1-line branch implementation). The dimensionality of the problem at hand can be further reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude by using native symmetries when building and querying databases. More details on the physics aspects of dimensionality reduction and degeneracy breaking effects can be found in \citet{2020ApJ...889..109D,2021ApJ...912...18J}, \citet{schiffmann2021} and \citet{par2022}.
