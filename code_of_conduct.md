# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, non-discriminatory, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
the developer contact email in the repository. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders will use one of the following actions based on the severity of the incident:

### 1. Correction

### 2. Warning

### 3. Temporary Ban

### 4. Permanent Ban
