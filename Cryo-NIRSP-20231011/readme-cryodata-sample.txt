Two sample public access datsets from Proposal ID: pid_2_112

This proposal requests DKIST observations in coordination with Solar Orbiter Remote Science Window#11 planned for 2023-10-12 to 2023-10-19. It is one of three experiments proposed for execution during this window, under DKIST Director’s Discretionary Time, to create community data sets that advance DKIST’s science mission collaterally with Solar Orbiter. Each features a common science justification with related but distinct observing strategies.
