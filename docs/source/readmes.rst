Thorough Readme Files
======================

.. warning::
   * The sections below are dynamically linked to standalone readme markdown files. A documentation rebuild will capture changes in any of the files.
   * Consequentially, some dynamic links to functions or other documents will not work when displayed here as they would from the direct rendering of the readmes. This is because relative paths cannot be kept consistent.
